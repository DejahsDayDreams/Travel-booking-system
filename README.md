A travel booking system in C# on the console


The main goal of this project is to create a C# console application for Travelstart, a travel firm that aims to help revive the tourism business after the COVID-19 outbreak. Clients will be able to quickly book overseas trips by picking their favorite destination, vehicle, and hotel using the application.

The user will be offered with a list of five places to begin the booking process: New York, Canberra, Tokyo, London, and Moscow. Each area is assigned a unique currency and conversion rate. For example, one US dollar is worth 16 ZAR (South African Rand). The flight will also have a set cost of 200 units of the currency of the specified location.

After selecting a place, the user will be able to select one of five vehicles for rent, each with its own price in the currency of the chosen region. The Renault Kwid, Volkswagen Polo Vivo, Toyota Corolla Quest, Volkswagen T-Roc, and BMW 3 Series are among the available vehicles.

After selecting a vehicle, the user will be able to select a hotel from a range of one to five-star options. The cost of each hotel, like the other options, will be determined by the currency of the chosen region.

The application will calculate the total cost of the trip in ZAR throughout the selecting process. The expenses of flights, automobiles, and accommodations will be converted from their respective currencies to ZAR using the stated exchange rates.

The user will be given the choice to confirm or cancel the trip after finishing the selecting procedure. A celebratory message will be displayed once the user confirms the travel. If a user cancels, they will be encouraged to try again.

To provide a simple and efficient user interface, the application will be designed as a C# console application. It will follow the specifications, assuring precise cost computations and currency conversions. The goal is to develop a user-friendly application that streamlines the booking process and contributes to the tourism industry's rebirth.

Travelstart's goal is to attract clients and let them enjoy their travels with simplicity and comfort by providing an intuitive and dependable platform for booking foreign vacations.
